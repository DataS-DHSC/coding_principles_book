# Write Easy to Read Code {#easy_to_read}

(ref:easytoreadintro)

**You Must** - Use meaningful names and follow the [DHSC adopted style](#style_guides) for your language.

**You Should** - Use a [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) or code formatter to ensure that your code conforms to the style guide. 

**You Could** - Review your code with colleagues to make ensure your names and style promote understanding.

## Style Guides
Most languages have several available style guides, which define a set of conventions to produce clean and consistently formatted code. Your style guide will define things like:

* How to use indentation and spacing
* Line length
* Add comment blocks at the start of your code
* Favour named indexes and iterators

DHSC has adopted a single style for each language to promote consistency. See 
[style guides](#style_guides) and 
[Linters](#linters) for more.

## Meaningful Names {#meaningful_names}
Names convey meaning, naming functions & variables well can remove the need for
a comment and make life easier for other readers. This includes your future self!

Find a balance: avoid meaningless names like `obj` or `foo`; but don't put an entire sentence in a variable name.

Use single-letter variables only where the use or meaning is clear - such as an iterator for a loop,
or where the letter represents a well-known mathematical property (think: $e = mc^2$).

## Avoid Overlaps {#dont_overlap}
When naming things be wary of overlapping with other meanings. In one context, using $e$ for energy or $i$ for an iterator might be sensible, but in another context might be confused with $e$ for exponent and $i$ for imaginary as in: $e^{iθ} = cos(θ) + i sin(θ)$.

Be conscious of overlapping names with things which are parts of the language, or popular functions. 
For example in Python, you probably want to avoid common abbreviated library names (`np` or `pd`), or in R be careful about overwriting things like `c` which is the name of the function used to make a vector.

## Name Formats
Follow your style guide and format your names consistently (i.e. using [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) or [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)).
