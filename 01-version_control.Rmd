# Use Version Control {#version_control}
It's important to version control your code so you and your collaborators can track changes over time, trace back errors, and retrieve old versions.
Doing version control well can be tricky, fortunately, there are tools to help you.

**You Must** - Use version control and follow guidance on coding in the open.

**You Should** - Use standard tools (Git & GitHub) to help you version control code.

**You Could** - Use Git & GitHub collaboratively and agree a version control pattern with your team.

## Git - (program for version control)
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is the most popular way to version control code. You can tell Git to keep track of a folder full of code (a repository or 'repo'). As you make changes, Git identifies them and asks which should be kept (or 'committed'), and for a comment identifying why. It uses this to maintain a log of all the changes. This log can be used to restore old versions.

## GitHub - (service for storing code version controlled using git)
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular place to store git repositories. Storing your repository on GitHub has some key benefits:

* It acts as a backup of your code & its history
* Other people can see your code, download it and collaborate with you.

As such, using a service like GitHub is a good way to ensure that your code is available to your team, and that knowledge is transferred.

## Using Git & GitHub Effectively
To make effective use of Git and GitHub:

* Follow the [GDS Git Style Guide](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/git.html)

* Commit code in small chunks, as often as possible, and write a descriptive comment with each commit. This makes your repository much more useful in the future and is called doing ['atomic commits'](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/atomic_commits_with_git).

* Commit changes using an account which is specific to you so that it is clear in future who changed what.

* Define a version control pattern which explains how you use git as a team. This could include how you use [branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell), how you merge changes and how to handle [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).

## Code in the Open
GitHub repositories can be *open* (shared with anyone) or *private* (shared only with selected collaborators).

The [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice#be-open-and-use-open-source) encourages us to 'be open and use open source'. As such, **code should be open unless there is a good reason for it not to be.**

Good reasons for code to be private might be that it includes classified material, or information on an unreleased policy. GDS have published guidance on this for both [external](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed), and [internal](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/publish-opensource-code.html) use.

## Manual Version Control
It is *possible* to manually keep track of your code by systematically keeping copies of your code as you modify it and maintaining a corresponding log of all changes to the code. The log should include: What has changed, why, and a link to the relevant copy of the files. It is recommended to use version control tools (git) instead of this manual process.
