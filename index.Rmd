# Introduction {-}
These principles are designed with the aim of improving coding standards and consistency within the department.


Adoption of these principles should improve quality, facilitate collaboration and enable effective QA of code. The principles are not language specific. This is to maximise uptake and provide a uniform set of values across languages.

The principles are designed to be achievable by all DHSC analysts producing code. Each Principle is flexible and has multiple levels:

* **Must** - you aren't finished until your code has met this standard.
* **Should** - do this unless you are ready to justify not doing so.
* **Could** - things you can do to improve your code beyond the base standard.
