## Aqua Book Guidance
The
[Aqua book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government)
contains guidance on documentation that should be in place as part of a quality assurance process for any analysis. This includes code based analysis.
See [Aqua Book Guidance for Technical Documentation](#aqua) for more.

## Document as you Go
Don't fall into the trap of assuming documentation is something which is produced at the end.
The best time to put together the documentation is as you are planning or doing the work - while it is fresh in your mind.
This also means that switching projects wont result in undocumented work.

## Use a Documentation Generator
There are popular tools for generating documentation from your code and comments. These lighten the load of producing and publishing good documentation, and encourage you to produce thorough documentation.

There are [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_documentation_generators) documentation generators.
[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) or [Roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/)
are recommended.
