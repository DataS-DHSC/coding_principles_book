# Be Reproducible {#reproducible}
Within DHSC analysis is used to enable evidence based decision making.
A piece of evidence which you cannot rely on being able to reproduce is not much good.
There are many reasons your code may not work correctly if someone else tries to run it, as such there is a responsibility to understand how to make your analysis simple and easy to reproduce.

**You Must** - Keep track of what you have done and document it unambiguously so that someone else can recreate it.

**You Should** - Write portable code, in a standard project structure so that it is _easy_ for someone else to run it.

**You Could** - Turn your code into a package / library / module, learn and promote RAP techniques, or use containers to achieve reproducibility.

## Documenting for reproducibility
To be able to reproduce your analysis a colleague may need the following:

* The right copy of the code
* The right versions of any dependencies (i.e. libraries used in the code)
* The platform on which code is run
    * operating system
    * folder structure
    * machine specifications
* The source data, or details of how to get it.

At the most basic level, documenting all of these will go a long way to making your analysis reproducible.
It might not make it _easy_ to reproduce however.

## Portability
There are some simple thing you can do to improve the chance that your code runs on other computers:

* Use relative paths, not absolute paths. ([Wikipedia - Absolute and Relative Paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29#Absolute_and_relative_paths)).
* Use a standard and consistent structure for organising your work. See [Projects and Environments](#projects) for more details.

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines
There is a government community dedicated to the production of reproducible analysis.
See [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](#reproducible) for more.

## Packages and Modules
Most languages have a standard structure which is used to share code and documentation with other people. You will likely have used code in this structure (libraries / packages / modules) when performing your analysis. Typically these structures include documentation, information about dependencies, and tests.

There is no reason you can't use the same approach to sharing your analysis! See [Packages](#packages) for more.

## Containers & Virtual Machines
Containers allow you to manage the whole environment which a bit of code runs in. They are powerful but perhaps more technically involved than packaging your code or using project structures to manage your environment. See [Containers](#containers) for more.
