# Write Flexible Code {#flexible_code}

(ref:flexiblecodeintro)

**You Must** - Break your code into chunks, each with a clear purpose and don't repeat yourself. Think about, and document the way your code might break with different inputs.

**You Should** - Include input validation in your code.

**You Could** - Implement and test thorough error handling. Consider writing and sharing general purposes 'tool' code, especially if you solve a problem someone else might have.

##  Break up your code and don't repeat yourself
[Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is a common idea in programming. Instead of writing a bit of code several times to repeat an operation, you would re-use the same code by turning it into a function (or some other re-useable chunk - a method or subroutines).

You should look to break up your code into chunks rather than working in a single long script or program.
Each chunk of code should have a clear purpose.
You can then use call on these chunks of code to build your analysis.

There are many reasons to do this:

* It's easier to see the structure of your code.  
* It's easier to make changes to your code.
* It's easier to understand what has changed and what the effect is.
* You only have to document each chunk once.

There are some common [coding styles](#coding_styles) for breaking down a program into chunks.

## Error Handling
Its likely your code will be asked to do something you didn't design it for, and it will break.

You do know however what your code *should* be doing, what the input is expected to look like, and the properties of the output. You also probably have an idea of what your would *like* it to do when it doesn't work correctly.

You can use error or [exception handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling_syntax) to control the errors and warnings that your code produces.
This can allow you to and choose:
* Where your code breaks - by adding validation to a function input
* How your code breaks - by providing alternate code to be run in the event of an error.
* What it tells a user - by providing your own error messages which guide the user to a solution

There are automated techniques such as [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) available to check how your code and error handling responds to different inputs.
