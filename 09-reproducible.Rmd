# Be Reproducible {#reproducible}

(ref:reproducibleintro)

**You Must** - Keep track of what you have done and document it [unambiguously](#unambiguous_docs) so that someone else can recreate it.

**You Should** - Write [portable](#portability) code, in a standard project structure so that it is _easy_ for someone else to run it.

**You Could** - Turn your code into a [package / library / module](#packages), learn and promote [RAP](#rap_section) techniques, or use [containers](#containers) to achieve reproducibility.

## Unambiguous documentation for reproducibility {#unambiguous_docs}
To be able to reproduce your analysis a colleague may need the following:

* The right copy of the code
* The right versions of any dependencies (i.e. libraries used in the code)
* The platform on which code is run
    * operating system
    * folder structure
    * machine specifications
* The source data, or details of how to get it.

At the most basic level, documenting all of these will go a long way to making your analysis reproducible.
It might not make it _easy_ to reproduce however.

## Portability {#portability}
There are some simple thing you can do to improve the chance that your code runs on other computers:

* Use relative paths, not absolute paths. ([Wikipedia - Absolute and Relative Paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29#Absolute_and_relative_paths)).
* Use a standard and consistent structure for organising your work. See [Projects and Environments](#projects) for more details.

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines {#rap_section}
There is a government community dedicated to the production of reproducible analysis.
See [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](#rap) for more.

## Packages and Modules {#packages}
Most languages have a standard structure which is used to share code and documentation with other people. You will likely have used code in this structure (libraries / packages / modules) when performing your analysis. Typically these structures include documentation, information about dependencies, and tests.

There is no reason you can't use the same approach to sharing your analysis! See [Packages](#packages) for more.

## Containers & Virtual Machines {#containers}
Containers allow you to manage the whole environment which a bit of code runs in. They are powerful but perhaps more technically involved than packaging your code or using project structures to manage your environment. See [Containers](#containers) for more.
