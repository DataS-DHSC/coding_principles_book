# DHSC Adopted Style Guides {#style_guides}
In line with the [easy to read](#easy_to_read) principle DHSC has adopted a single style guide for each language.
Please use this style; consistency will make it easier for colleagues to understand, QA and improve your code!

| Language 	| DHSC Adopted Style Guide 	|
|----------	|--------------------------	|
| R        	| [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)|
| Python   	| [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) |

If you or your team think that the style decision is wrong - please get in touch!

# Linters & Code Formatters
