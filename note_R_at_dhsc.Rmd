# R at DHSC {#r_at_dhsc}

The following are the DHSC [sensible defaults](#sensible_defaults) for R:

## R Version & IDE
The dominant IDE for R is Rstudio, which comes packaged with R. 
For a new project you should use the latest version of Rstudio available from the software portal.

## Default Packages and Add Ins {#r_default_packages}

Default to packages from the [Tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/).These have been carefully designed to work together effectively as part of a modern data analysis workflow. More info can be found here: [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz). 

For example:

   * Prefer tibbles to data.frames
   * Use ggplot2 rather than base graphics
   * Use the pipe `%>%` rather than nesting function calls. (...but not always e.g. see [here](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/603883121197514752)).
   * Prefer `purrr` to the `apply` family of functions. See [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions)

## Project Workflow {#r_projects}
Always work in a project. See the guide to [Using Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects).

Projects functionality is broken in DHSC's packaged version of Rstudio - see the fix [here](R/fix_projects.R)

## Packaging Your Code {#r_package}
Packages are the fundamental unit of reproducible R code. 
Therefore, if possible, build an R Package to share and document your code. 

Hadley's book on [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) is an effective guide on how to produce a package.

The [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package has lots of useful shortcuts for package builders.

## Managing Dependencies {#r_dependencies}
There are two key competing ways of managing dependencies for an R Project:

* [`packrat`](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) - current established way to manage R dependencies
* [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) - rapidly maturing, successor to packrat.

* Rbloggers [post on renv](https://www.r-bloggers.com/reproducible-environments/)
* Rstudio page on combining [renv and docker](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/docker.html)

## Unit Testing {#r_tests}
Use the `testthat` package for performing unit tests. 
For details see the ['tests' chapter of R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html).
