# Use Sensible Defaults {#sensible_defaults}

(ref:sensibledefaultsintro)

**You Must** - Be aware of the [defaults](#general_defaults), understand why we have them and follow them unless you can explain how the benefits of an alternative approach outweigh those of consistency.

**You Should** - Help define what the defaults should be, and actively participate in discussion and debate to keep them up to date and relevant.

**You Could** - Proactively review and compare the defaults used with the way you work.
