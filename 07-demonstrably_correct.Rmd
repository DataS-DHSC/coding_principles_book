# Be Demonstrably Correct {#demonstrably_correct}
We need to be confident in the outputs we provide.
Just because something is done with code doesn't mean it is more likely to be answering the right question, using the right inputs, or doing the calculation correctly.
As with any analysis, the defence against this is having a clear and robust audit trail which can _demonstrate_ that our output is correct.

 **You Must** - Hold your code to the same standard as regular analysis and record evidence demonstrating it produces the right output.

 **You Should** - Use version control to unambiguously link QA to code and outputs and construct automated tests to provide confidence that changes don't break things.

 **You Could** - Make a fully automated reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP).

## QA Applies to Code
Code is not exempt from Quality Assurance processes. As with any other analysis you need to record evidence that your code is:

* doing the right thing,
* structured in a sensible way
* using valid inputs
* producing a sensible answer

## Testing Frameworks
Your code and analysis will grow and evolve. You wont have time to QA every version, and it can be tricky to keep track of which bits of QA have been made obsolete due to new or changed code.

There are frameworks which help you construct and run tests on units of your code. These can be a good way to demonstrate that code is working correctly as you update it.
See [Testing Frameworks](#testing_frameworks) for more details.

## Version Control Integration
Having unit tests, and QA is good. Ideally however you can tie a particular result to a particular version of the QA'd and tested code. You _could_ do this manually, by keeping the code for each set of outputs.

Using git for [version control](#version_control) makes this process easy. You can:

* Make a commit to the repository with a note like: `output for XYZ on dd/mm/yy` so you can identify the version used to produce outputs in future.
* Use tools such as
[gitpython](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
or
[git2r](https://docs.ropensci.org/git2r/)
to include the
[git commit hash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History)
which identifies the current version of the code in the output.
This can then later be retrieved from your git repository.

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines
Once you have some QA'd, version controlled and test covered code, the biggest source of error will be the manual steps performed by the analyst running it.
You can eliminate a lot of this, see
[Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](#reproducible).
