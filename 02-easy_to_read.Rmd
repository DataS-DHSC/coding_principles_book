# Write Easy to Read Code {#easy_to_read}

Keep your code easy to read by using sensible names and a consistent style.

**You Must** - Use meaningful names and follow the [DHSC adopted style](note_style_guides.md) for your language.

**You Should** - Use a [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) or code formatter to ensure that your code conforms to the style guide.

**You Could** - Review your code with colleagues to make ensure your names and style promote understanding.

## Style Guides
Most languages have several available style guides, which define a set of conventions to produce clean and consistently formatted code. Your style guide will define things like:

* How to use indentation and spacing
* Line length
* Add comment blocks at the start of your code
* Favour named indexes and iterators

DHSC has adopted a single style for each language to promote consistency. See [style guides](note_style_guides.md) for more.

## Meaningful Names
Names convey meaning, naming functions & variables well can remove the need for
a comment and make life easier for other readers. This includes your future self!

Find a balance: avoid meaningless names like `obj` or `foo`; but don't put an entire sentence in a variable name.

Use single-letter variables only where the letter represents a well-known
mathematical property (e.g. e = mc^2), or where their meaning is otherwise
clear.

## Name Formats
Follow your style guide and format your names consistently (i.e. using [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) or [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)).
