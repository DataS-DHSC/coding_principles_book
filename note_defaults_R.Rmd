# DHSC Sensible Defaults for R {#r_defaults}
The following are the DHSC [sensible defaults](principle_sensible_defaults.md) for R:

* Always work in a project

* Default to packages from the [Tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/), because they have been carefully designed to work together effectively as part of a modern data analysis workflow. More info can be found here: [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz). For example:
   * Prefer tibbles to data.frames
   * Use ggplot2 rather than base graphics
   * Use the pipe `%>%` rather than nesting function calls, but not always e.g. see [here](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/603883121197514752).
   * Prefer `purrr` to the `apply` family of functions. See [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions)

* If possible, build an R [Package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) to share and document your code. Packages are the fundamental unit of reproducible R code.
