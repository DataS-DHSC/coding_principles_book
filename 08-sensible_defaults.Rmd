# Use Sensible Defaults {#sensible_defaults}

(ref:sensibledefaultsintro)

**You Must** - Be aware of the [defaults](#general_defaults), understand why we have them and follow them unless you can explain how the benefits of an alternative approach outweigh those of consistency.

**You Should** - Help define what the defaults should be, and actively participate in discussion and debate to keep them up to date and relevant.

**You Could** - Proactively review and compare the defaults used with the way you work.

## General Defaults {#general_defaults}
* Use 'Tidy' data. See the [tidy data principle](#data_structure)!
* Use git for version control of code (rather than SVN, Mercurial etc). See the [version control principle](#version_control)
* Use a standardised template for your type of project, this will help people find things. See the [reproducible principle](#reproducible)
* Use preexisting packages and code before writing your own.
* Use popular, mature and well supported packages in preference to up & coming ones.

## Language Specific Defaults:
In addition to the general principles, there are some sensible defaults which are language specific:
